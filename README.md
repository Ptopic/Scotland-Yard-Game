<h3>Build with:</h3>

» Frontend -> react.js

Disclaimer!! - Project is built only for Ipad 9th gen, positions will not work on other screen sizes. It is built with sole purpose to allow for me and my friends to play the board game more easily. Map is just an image and positions are overlaping it so its not built with actual html code but it might be built with actual code in the future.
